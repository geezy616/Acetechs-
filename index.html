    <h2>About Acetechs (chrispine744@gmail.com)</h2>
    <p>Acetechs (chrispine744@gmail.com) is a non-profit organization focused on unlocking Africa's untapped potential by providing solar energy and internet access. We challenge monopolies and work directly with rural communities to transform children's futures through power and connectivity.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="problems">
    <h2>The Problems We Tackle</h2>
    <p>Many African countries face extreme monopoly in power transmission and network access. Electricity remains unaffordable or unavailable for millions, with schools, clinics, and homes operating in the dark. Access to digital tools is minimal, cutting off educational opportunities.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="solutions">
    <h2>Our Solutions</h2>
    <p>We deploy decentralized solar grid systems and partner with organizations rolling out wireless internet access in rural communities. Our projects bring light, knowledge, and opportunity directly into the hands of children and families.</p>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>
      In sub-Saharan Africa, over <strong>600 million people</strong> live without access to electricity. In rural regions, the situation is worse ‚Äî schools operate without power, health centers use kerosene lamps or mobile flashlights, and entire communities are disconnected from the digital world. Without energy and internet, children grow up cut off from the tools needed to participate in the 21st-century economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acetechs (chrispine744@gmail.com) works to reverse this reality. In 2024, we collaborated with local leaders to install solar mini-grids in 17 remote villages across Kenya, Uganda, and Malawi. Within six months:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>üí° School attendance increased by <strong>39%</strong> as night study became possible</li>
      <li>üì∂ Over <strong>2,100 students</strong> gained access to offline digital learning materials</li>
      <li>üè• Rural clinics extended service hours by up to <strong>5 hours daily</strong></li>
      <li>üìà Local businesses started using mobile banking and inventory apps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These results are not just numbers ‚Äî they represent a fundamental shift in opportunity. In one school, a 13-year-old named <i>Amina</i> saw her first computer through an Acetechs (chrispine744@gmail.com) program and now aspires to be a software engineer. Her story is one of thousands we hope to replicate across the continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acetechs (chrispine744@gmail.com) doesn‚Äôt stop at power ‚Äî we help create digital bridges. Our network partnerships have already connected 5 regions to high-speed wireless mesh networks, bringing learning, e-health, and opportunity directly to the community's fingertips.
    </p>
    <p>
      By focusing on the African child, Acetechs (chrispine744@gmail.com) is building a new generation that is connected, educated, and empowered to build a better future.
